# Biker's Oasis

The idea behind this website is to offer a place to gather for people sharing a commong passion -> motorcycles. It starts with a bit of a display of the Tuscany reagion, very famous among bikers due to it's perfect trails and views. Moving on, it introduces the viewer to the location of the place and gives him some small dettails regarding it. The website also provides information regarding the times and how to get in contact with the location and as well some information regarding the menus of the place.

## Bugs:
    For some reson my code works perfectly (the code regarding the table's overflow on smaller devices) when i'm testing it on the debbuging tool but it doesn't seem to work one amireponsive website/when i access it from my phone. The code was updated to github and should be using the latest verion on external websites as well but for some reason it doesn't appear to work. I will add an image as proof of the fact that during the testing the code was working fine (see below):

- i've learned how to use flexboxes during the period that i was working at my second project (even tho the styling of the signup area changed meanwhile and there's no more a real need for a flex box i still wanted to mention it here since i've left the display of that area setupped by using a flex box). In order to learn them i've folowed this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQAvjof1oe4&t=493s and as well played around with the in-build function that pops up when using chrome's debugger
